          "description": "Ethereum’s biggest-ever upgrade — the move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism — is right around the corner. But while the Merge should add security and sustainability, it doesn’t include sharding, the long-anticipated method of scaling the network.  In Part I of our conversation with Ethereum Foundation (EF) researcher Danny Ryan, who’s helped coordinate the upgrade...

          "description": "After years of research, development and testing, Ethereum will transition from proof of work to proof of stake in the coming months. Instead of “miners” using computational energy to process transactions, “validators” will lock up, or stake, their assets in the network in return for ETH rewards. The upshot is increased security and a much... Read More\nThe post What the Merge Means for Ethereum Today [Part 1] appeared first on Future.",
